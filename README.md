Harken, for I bring tidings of a tool written in the language of serpents, Python, dedicated to the art of obfuscation, and aptly named after the pioneering first programmer, none other than Ada Lovelace herself.

PyLovelace, a Python obfuscation tool, named in honor of Ada Lovelace, bestows an elegant layer of obscurity upon your code, shielding it from reverse engineering attempts by safeguarding its inner workings from unauthorized inspection. Utilizing cutting-edge obfuscation techniques and brimming with an abundance of features, PyLovelace stands poised to emerge as a formidable contender to PyArmor's dominance in the field. And the best part? Even more features are in the pipeline, ensuring PyLovelace's status as a preeminent tool for Python code obfuscation. Not only is PyLovelace a powerful and versatile tool, but it also boasts a more affordable price point, making it an attractive option for developers seeking a cost-effective solution without compromising on quality or security.

## Features
- Single file obfuscation
- Module obfuscation
- Remove all comments
- Anti Python debugger
- Anti importing debugging packages
- Rename functions and classes
- Turn comments starting with `# pylovelace` into code. E.g. `# pylovelace print("test")` turns into `print("test")`.

## Planned Features / To Do
- Multiple modes of obfuscation (single file, with modules, etc.)
- Expire after a certain date

## Specialities

- PyLovelace preserves the __name\_\_ attribute.
- PyLovelace obfuscated files have a significant speed boost compared to other obfuscators.

## Supported Python Versions
- Python 3.11 only as of now, as I am currently focusing myself on the latest versions of Python.
- Python 3.12 soon
- Python 3.10 soon

## Supported Operating Systems
- Windows 10/11 only as of now.
- Linux soon.

## Installation

PyLovelace can be installed via pip:
`pip install pylovelace`

## Documentation

Documentation will be available on the [PyLovelace website](https://pylovelace.com). The website is currently under
development.

## License

A license for PyLovelace can be purchased [here](https://pyintellect.sell.app/product/pylovelace).
PyLovelace can be used without a license, but a 5KB file limit will apply.

# PyLovelace
A Python code obfuscation tool.
The usage will be via a command line interface.

## Features
- Single file obfuscation
- Module obfuscation
- Remove all comments
- Anti Python debugger
- Anti importing debugging packages
- Rename functions and classes
- Turn comments starting with `# pylovelace` into code. E.g. `# pylovelace print("test")` turns into `print("test")`.
